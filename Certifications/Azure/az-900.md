	- cost effective
		- pay as you go 
		- no upfront costs
`		- stop paying for resources that you don't need
	- Scalable
		- practically unlimited resources
		- vertical Scaling (scale up)
		- Horizontal Scaling (scale out)
		- Can be done manually or automatically 
	- Elastic 
		- increase decrease based on demand
		- accommodate unexpected spikes
		- reduce consumption during low uses
	- Up To Date
		- Latest Hardware is available 
		- Latest Software as well
		- Results in the IT maintenance cost

- Capital Expenditures: is an upfront cost with value that reduces over time
	- server costs
	- storage costs
	- network costs
	- backup and archival costs
	- business continuity and disaster recovery costs
	- datacenter infrastructure costs
	- technical personally
	
- benefits of the capex model
	- fixed costs 
	- budget friendly 
	- easy planning


- Operational Expenditures (OPEX): is an expense that you incur every monthb in which you consume
	- leasing cloud infrastructure 
	- leasing cloud software
	- charges for scaling resources 
	- per-user billing
	
-Benefits: 
	- you can use the auto scaled consumption: use resources only when you need them 

- There are three different cloud deployment models: Private, Public, and Hybrid
	- Private: when your servers and infastructure are on premisis(in house)
	- Public: when your servers and infastrucutre are off prim from a vender
	- hybrid: is a mixture of both (used mainly for security reasons) 

-Private cloub benefits: 
	- support any scenerio(legacy support)
	- complete control over infastructure and security
	- meet security, compliance and legal requirenments
-Private cloud cons: 
	- significant inital costs
	- limits to agility
	- demand for it skills and expertise
	
- Public cloud benefits: 
	- high scale and agility
	- pay as you go pricing: only pay for what you use
	- no hardware and datacenter maintenance requirements
	- lower technical skills requirements
- Public cloud cons: 
	- cannot support all legacy scenarios 
	- may not be able to meet all compliance needs
	- no control over hardware and services
	- some security requirements may not be met
- Hybrid Cloud benefits: 
	- can support any scenario(even legacy)
	- flexibility of choice for applications
	- implement specific security and compliance requirements
	- take advantage of economies of scale
- Hybrid cloud cons:

- What is azure? 
	- microsofts' cloud computing platform 
	- build manage and deploy applications on a global scale
	- targeted to developers and it specialists
	- Azure utilizes virtualization (Host o/s ----> hyperviser ----> virtual machines)
	- over 100 services provided 

- how it's built behind the scences: 
	- server rack to fabric controller to switch all controller by the orchestrator

- Azure history 
	- started as RED DOG
	- announced in 2008 
	- PAAS was the emphasis
	- compute and storage
	- made big shift in 2011
- Azure list of services: 
	- AI and ML
	- Analytics
	- Blockchain

------------------------------------------------- Module 3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Azure has a multitude of regions around the world in which datacenters are stored and can be accessed
	- they divide things up by: 
		- Geography
		- regional pair
		- region | region
		- DC|DC    DC|DC

- Availability Zones
	- physically seperated zones connected by a fiber optic network 
	- if one fails the other takes over

- Azure SLA's: Service level agreements
	- Formal document with 
		- microsofts commitment
		- perfomance targets(like uptime and connectivity)
		- service credits
	- sla per product or service 
- Performance Targets
	- uptime 
	- latency 
	- "five mimes" 99.999% of the time
	- if microsoft can't meet service times then they will compensate you for that...give you in house credits most of the time on your next billing

- Resiliency, Availability, and cost
	- application SLA = f(azureSLA's) 
	- resiliency == recover from failure
	- increase availability increase the complexity increase the cost
	- sla considerations 
		- automation
		- 99.9 may be enough 
		- Time window

-------------------------------------------------Module 6---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Azure compute concepts/services
	- four different ways to perform compute
		- Virtual Machines (RDP) or (SSH)
		- Containers (do not require their own os) (use the kernal of the host os) 
		- App Service (Host highley scalable enterprise grade web applications) 
		- Serverless (complete abstraction from underlying infastructure) 

- Azure Virtual Machines: 
	- allows you to create and run vms in the cloud
	- control the os
	- control of the config
	- install custom software
	- connect remotely 
	- provision in minutes from an image 
	- Custom images for "lift-and-shift' 

	- Availability Sets - Unplanned Maintenance
		-a logical grouping of two or more virtual machines that helps keep your application available 
			- fault domains
				-up to three 
				- physical seperation of the workloads
			- availability sets are strectched across fault domains 
			- update domains have groupings that can update/patch/restart at the same time while the others in the availability sets carry the load 
	- Azure Batch 
		- can be used to deploy update...etc... on large scales 
	- Scale Set 
		- contains a grouping of multiple virtual machines
		- controlled by a load balancer 

-azure container services
	- vms disadvantages
		- if your app has components that require different runtime env 
	- containers are lightweight 
	- don't require a full os boot
	- dont't require additional os
	- virtualize the os which allow you to run multiple applications across on os 

-Microservices
	- instead of building one monolith you build a muultitude of microservices that work together or independetly 
	- can seperate workload 
	- use multiple programming languages
	- independent release schedule 
	- easy rollback 
	
- Conatiner orchestration with kubernetes 
	- created with multiple nodes
		- docker inside the nodes as containers container engines
		- manages the placements of ports (single microservice) 
		- can dynamically move ports between nodes
			- if a port failes kuber restarts
			- if a node fails buber moves ports to another node 
	
	- scale a pod
	- stage deployment and rollback 
	- storage management with persistent volumes 
	- network management 
	- api for automation and extensibility 

	- supports both linux and windows containers
-------------------------------ACI (Azure Container Instances) 
	- helps with managing containers
----------------------------AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) 
	- complete orchestration service
-------------------------------ACR(Azure Container Registry) 
	- similar to docker hub 
	-

	- 

------------------------ Serverless 
	- pool of servers that the cloud vender maintains...
	- everytime that your code triggers it can be executed on a different server
	- schedual triggers, http triggers, event triggers
	- once your code completes you no longer will have acces to the local storage on the server in which your code executed 
	- 5 to 10 min availability per process for serverless computing 
	
----------------------- Azure Functions 
	- Code First(multiple coding languages)
