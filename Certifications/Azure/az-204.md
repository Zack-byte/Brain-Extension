# Azure Developer Associate (az-204)

---------------------- Common Business Problems
- to deliver high quality as a business you need to design and implement strict business proccesses 

business proccesses modeled in software are know as workflows
	
- Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems: 
	- Logic apps 
	- microsoft Power automate
	- WebJobs
	- Azure Functions 	
- Similarities between the four
	- all accept inputs
	- all run actions 
	- all include conditions 
	- all got outputs
- Microsoft azure offers Logic apps which allows you to design a workflow 
	- pretty much just lay your plan out 


- Logic Apps
	- a designer in azure used to plan orchestrate and maintain workflow/logic
	- you can do this in the logic app designer or through JSON code 
	- allows over 200 connectors 
		- provide an interface to an external service 
	- you can provide a custom connector if your system exposes a REST Api 

-Microsoft Power Automate
	- create workflows if you have no IT experienced
	- Four different flows you can create
		- automated = started by a trigger for some event 
		- button = runs on click
		- scheduled = you know how the fuck a schedular works
		- business process = models a business process like a stock ordering process 

- Azure Application Gateway 
	- is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web 
	applications 
		- can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP 		 request e.g(URI path or host headers) 
- Learn to classify needed data for the project in which you are about to embark
	- Structured Data: Relational Data E.G (SQL) 
	- Semi-structured data: utilizes tags to organize data E.G(key value pairs) NoSQL 

- three common serialization languages
	- XML (extensible Markup Language) 
	- JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation) 
	- YAML: Ain't Markup Language= is a relatively new data language that's growing in popularity because of it's human-friendliness 
		- line separation and indentation 
		- reduces the dependency on structural characters, like parentheses, commas and brackets. 

- Operations and Latency 

Azure Developer Associate Notes Continued: 
	- Logic Apps 
	- Microsoft Power Automate
	- WebJobs
	- Azure Functions 

These four technologies have some similarities 
	- they can all accept inputs an input is a piece of data or a file that is supplied to the workflow 
	- they can all run actions an actions is a simple operation that the worikflow executes and may often modify data or cause another action to be performed
	- tHEY CAN ALL INCLUDE CONDITIONS A CONDITION IS A TEST OFTEN RUN AGAISNTAN INPUT THAT MAY DECIDE WHICH ACTION TO execute next
	- they can all produce outputs an output is a piece of data or a file that is created by the workflow 



Design first technologies include: 
	- logic Apps: 
	- Microsoft Power Automate

Code First technoliges include: 
	- Azure Functions
	- WebJobs and the Webjobs SDK: 
		- are a part of Azure App Service that you can use to run a program or scirpt automatically 



Some business processes are simple but often they include challenges such as: 
	- they might involve many different steps sometimes with loops or conditional branches
	- they may be long running and complete over days or weeks as staff become available or because of other delays
	- they may involve several different systems such as databases web services email servers and other components
	- you may want to integrate a custom or third party system which may require a custom connector.
	- you may want non developers to be able to modify and update the workflow.

Azure function triggers: 
	- can activate with a multitude of different events....and can be used for a multitude of different reasons.



What is a CRON expression? : 
a cron expression is  a string that consists of sic fields that represent a set of times.
the order of the six fields in azure is {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week} 

for example a CRON expression to create a trigger that executes every five minutes looks lieke 


What is an HTTP trigger?:

	- provide authorized access by supplying keys
	- restrict which HTTP verbs are supported
	- reutrn data back to the caller
	- receive data through query string parameters or throught e request body
	- Support URL route templates to modify the function URL


Azure functions can only have one trigger associated with it 


Azure functions makes it easy for your function code to integrate with data and services through the power of bindings you declare the data sources to read and write and let Azure Functions take care of the rest


What is a Binding?
	- in azure Functions bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data form within your code. they make it easier to integrate with data stream consistently in a function you can have multiple bindings providing access to different data elements this is powerful because you can connect to your data sources without having to code specific connection logic (like data base connections or web API interfaces). 


THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BINDINGS: 
	- INPUT BINDINGS: connects to a data source our function can read data from these inputs 
	- OUPUT BINDINGS: connects to a data destination our function can write data to these destinations



Binding properties: 
	- Name: defines the function parameter through which you access the data for example in a queue input binding this is the name of the function parameter that receives the queue message content 
	- Type: identifies the type of binding for example the type of data or service we want to interact with
	- Direction: indicates the direction data is flowing for example is it an input or output binding

	Sometimes a property: 
		- Connection: provides the name of an app setting key that contains the connections string bindings use connection strings stored in app settings to keep secret out of the function code this makes your code more configurable and secure



Add an azure cosmos DB input binding
	- to read data from the database you need to define an input binding as you'll see you can configure a binding that can talk to your database in just a few steps 



Output bindings: as with input bindings there are mutltiple types of output bindings however not all types support both input an output you'll use them anytime you want

Az-204 Azure Developer Associate Notes: 
	
**  Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems: 
	
		- Logic Apps
		- Microsoft Power Automate
		- Webjobs
		- Azure Functions
	
	- Similarities between these four: 
		- they can ll accept inputs 
		- they can all run actions
		- they cal all include conditions
		- they can all produce outputs


Design First Technologies: Both include UI's for convineince and non-tech savy individuals
	- Logic Apps: 
		- Is a service withing azure that you can use to automate orchestrate and integrate disparate components of a distributed application 
		- Has a UI
		- JSON Code option available in Code View 
		- Connectors: is a logic apps component that provides an interface to an external service (over 200 available) 
		- prebuilt or create your own connector through REST API
	- Power Automate: 
		- Is a service that you can use to create workflows even when you have no development or IT Pro experience 
		- Website or mobile app
		- Built on Logic Apps
		- Four workflows: 
			- Automated: that is started by a trigger from some event 
			- Button: manualyy from mobile device or website
			- Scheduled: on a set time
			- Business Process: 

Logic Apps are usually better for IT proffesionals and Power Automate for non-IT Professionals

Code First technologies
	- WebJobs and WebJobs SDK: 
		- Write code in several different languages 
			- Shell Script(Windows, Powershell, Bash)
			- ASP.NET PHP, Python, Node, JavaScriptg
			- .NET Framework C# VB.NET
		- Continuous: run in a continuous loop 
		- Triggered: run when you manually start them or on a schedual 

	- Azure Functions: 
		- Small pieces of event driven code no infrastructure to host 
		- C#, Java, JavaScript, powershell, python 
		- Consumption Plan option: Only pay for the time that your code runs



- Function apps may choose two types of service plans the first is the consumption service plan the second plan in called the azure app service plan
	- Consumption service plan when using the azure serverless application platform provides automatic scaling and bills you when your functions are running. comes with configurable timeout period 
	- azure app service plan: allows you to avoid timeout periods by having your function run continuously on a VM that you define. You are responsible for managing the app resources the function runs on technically not a serverless 
	
- function apps must be linked to a storage account
