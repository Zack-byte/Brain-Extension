# Azure Quantum
- Azure Quantum provides the best development environment to create quantum algorithms for multiple platforms at once while preserving flexibility to tune the same algorithms for specific systems. 

- **Open Ecosystem**: Quantum gives you diverse access to quantum software, hardware, and solutions from Microsoft and partners. Currently available programming languages are Qiskit, Cirq, and Q#.

## Solutions
- **Quantum Computing** Learn, experiment and prototype with quantum resources.
- **Optimization** develope solutions that help you reduce the cost of operation.

## Why Use Quantum Solutions
- They harness the unique behavior of quantum physics - such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference and apply it to computing. 

- Exponentially more information can be piped through and exponentially harder problems. 

## Quantum Computing
- if you aim to simulate quantum mechanical problems, such as chemical reactions, biological reactions, or material formations, quantum works exceptionally well because they use quantum phenomena in their computation. 

- Aims to speed up progress in diverse areas such as financial services, machine learning, and unstructured data searches, 

## Quantum Languages
- Why a quantum programming language? Because you want to write algorithms, not circuits.

- The Q# language for example doesn't specify whether qubits are logical or physical. This can be decided by the runtime when the algorithm is executed. 


## Outsourced Quantum Resources
- Through the quantum program microsoft outsources the actual computation on quantum hardware to other corps such as.
  - TOSHIBA
  - PASQAL
  - 10Bit
  - IONQ
  - etc...

- Each of these providers can offer different sets of hardware and capabilities in their quantum hardware.
