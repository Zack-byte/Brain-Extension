# Azure Pipelines
`Continuous Integration (CI)` and `Continuous Delivery (CD)` are core ideals of modern development techniques. In short they are in place to help expediate the idea to implementation turnover in order to produce results and satisfy customers ASAP in today's applications. Many cloud providers offer solutions for these two ideals and Microsoft's is `Azure Pipelines`.

To provide more context below are snippets from Microsoft's **"What are Azure Pipelines"** Documentation that explain what Azure Pipelines are designed to solve.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```
 is the practice used by development teams of automating merging and testing code. Implementing CI helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle, which makes them less expensive to fix. Automated tests execute as part of the CI process to ensure quality. Artifacts are produced from CI systems and fed to release processes to drive frequent deployments.
```

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
```
is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments. Deploying and testing in multiple environments increases quality. CI systems produce deployable artifacts, including infrastructure and apps. Automated release processes consume these artifacts to release new versions and fixes to existing systems. Monitoring and alerting systems run continually to drive visibility into the entire CD process.
```

### Continuous Testing (CT)
```
on-premises or in the cloud is the use of automated build-deploy-test workflows, with a choice of technologies and frameworks that test your changes continuously in a fast, scalable, and efficient manner.
