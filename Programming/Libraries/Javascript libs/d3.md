# D3 Js
- Data Driven Documents (D3) is a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data.
- D3 helps you brind data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. 
- D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework.
- Combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.


## Introduction
- D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM, and then apply data-driven trasformations to the document.
- For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart
- with smooth transitions and interaction.

- D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead. D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data.
- This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS.
- With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. 
- D3's functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules.
