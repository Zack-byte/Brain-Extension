# Big (O) Basics

Measure the efficiency of a piece of code by using BIG O
two different types of big o 
	- time 
		- timed out
		- performance
	- space is related to memory 
		- out of memory
		- how much extra variables or data structures are needed for this algorithm  
	
- Compare algorithms using BIG O 




Grading time and space 
	- in relative terms 
	- relative to the size of the input 
if we double the size of an input to they scale proportionately

linear time is O[n]
it's a 1 to 1 

different types
MOST EFFICIENT
	- constant = O[1]
	- logarithmic O[log n] 
	- linear O[n] 
	- linear * log O[n log n]
	- quadratic O[n * n] 
	- exponential O[2^n]
LEAST EFFICIENT^
