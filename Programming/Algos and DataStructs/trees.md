# Trees
- A data structure that is made up of a interconnected nodes that can be of any type (string, bool, etc...)

- Most basic qualifications for a tree
  - has a root node that has zero or more children
  - every child node has zero or more children

- **Leafs** are nodes that have zero children

## Binary Trees
- Trees in which each node can only have up to two children.

## Binary Search Trees
- Binary Trees that follow the criteria of "Left Child Node is <= parent node < Right Child Node"

## Balanced Trees
- Trees in which an **insert** or **find** operation can run within the time constraint of **O(log n)**
- E.g of balanced Trees are **AVL** or  **red-black**

## Complete Trees
- Trees in which all layers are full expect possible the last, which fills left to right.


## Full Trees
- Type of Binary Tree
- Trees in which all children have zero or 2 children

## Perfect Trees
- All rows are filled, and all leaf nodes are on the same level.
