# Angular Ivy
- Ivy is the code name for Angular's next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline.
- Angular 9 switched to Ivy in place of the legacy "View Engine"


## AOT and Ivy
- AOT compilation with Ivy is faster and should be used by default. 
- When using application internationalization (i18n) with Ivy, translation merging also requires the use of AOT compilation.
