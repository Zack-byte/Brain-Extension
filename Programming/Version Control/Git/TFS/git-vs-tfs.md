# Git Vs TFS

Git vs TFS

-TFS: Team Foundation Server 

- Key Difference: TFS is a centralized version control system and Git is a distributed version control system. 

- With TFS, repositories are stored on a central server and developers check-out a working copy, which is a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time 

- with Git, developers clone the entire repository to their machines, including all of the history 


Hyperlink: simply a link, is a reference to data that the user can follow by clicking or tapping. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called anchor text. 


CVCS: Centralized Version Control System: e.g = TFS (there is a central version, and team members check out a screenshot so to speech of a cwv) 

DVCS: Distributed Version control system: e.g = GIT (there is a central version, however the entire repository is also stored locally on developers machines and they can make changes and implement them locally as well as update them to the central verison)
