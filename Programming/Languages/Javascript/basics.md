# Javascript

-JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". it is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try... catch blocks function the same as in these languages


- Created by Brendan Eich at Netspace and has been updated since to conform to ECMA-262 edition 5 and later.
- Engine Codenamed SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C/C++. 
- There are a multitude of Javascript Engines
  - Google's V8 (Engine used by Node.js)
  - JavascriptCore (SquirrelFish/Nitro) used in some WebKit browsers such as Apple Safari
  - Carakan in old versions of Opera 
  - The Chakra engine used in Internet Explorer

- Each of Mozilla's JavaScript engines expose a public API which application developers can use to integrate JavaScript into their software.
- Most common host of JS is web-browsers
- Web browsers typically use the public API to create **host objects** responsible for reflecting the DOM into the JavaScript.
- Another common application for JavaScript is as a (Web) server side scripting language

- JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include:
  - runtime object construction
  - variable parameter lists
  - function variables
  - dynamic script creation (via eval)
  - object introspection
  - and source code recovery (programs can de-compile function bodies back into their source text)
