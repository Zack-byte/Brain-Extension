# .Net 6
**The Final Form of .NET...** _Well let's hope at least_ :sweat_smile:

Over the _decades_ at this point Microsoft has put countless hours, manpower, and money into their bi-polar child `.Net`. Don't get me wrong though, .Net is great, cross platform and has support on multiple languages both scripting and non.

My Personal experience with .Net originated with `.NetFramework4.7.2` and needless to say, it's gotten even better and more expansive over the years. 

At this point it takes alot of explaining to cover everything that .NET now covers. In short it's an ecosystem that helps and allows developers to create all kinds of applications both cloud and native.

I do plan on coming back for a "refresher run" to not only solidify and expand my knowledge but to flesh out these Damn notes. **However** at the moment I'm going over two things
1. Setting up my environment to code and run a `.NET 6` `C#` project using `vsCode` as my primary editor
2. Programming that `.Net 6` application to expose API's that will do extremely simple Docx data parsing.

## Let's get started
The Visual Studio Code documentation actually has a great thread on how to get this setup [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet) and that's what I'll be keying off of to get my setup rolling.

### Options
- **Coding Pack**: Installs Vscode, .NET SDK, .NET Extensions
- **Download sauce separately**: .NET 6, .NET Extensions

**Install .NET 6** - You'll need the runtime and the SDK
Found: [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Install Extensions
VsCode Extensions are honestly preferential in this case I'm only installing 
- **C#** _For Visual Studio Code_

## Create A C# App
:warning: **Restart your terminals after you install .NET 6, if you're using VsCode you can do a `Developer Refresh Window`.**

To create a new .NET console application navigate to your desired directory and run
```powershell
# This will create a new .NET console application
dotnet new console

# Will run the .NET console application
dotnet run
```

Now I create my project in a git repository in which the remote was hosted on github, in this case I made sure to add a `.gitignore` file in my directory that included this...(I pulled this from the internet btw :wink:)
