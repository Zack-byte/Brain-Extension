# XML Serialization in C#

- XML serialization is the process of converting an object's public properties and fields to a serial format for storage or transport. 

- XML deserializations re-creates the object in its original state from the XML output.

- The data in your objects is described using constructs like classes, fields, properties, primitive types, arrays, and even embedded XML in the form of Xml Element or XmlAttribute objects. 

- You can either create your own classes, annotated with attributes, or using the XML Schema Definition Tool (Xsd.exe) to generate classes based on an existing XML Schema definition (XSD) document. 

- **XSD** (XML Schema Definition Tool).
  - Generates XML schema or common language runtime classes from XDR, XML, and XSD files or from classes in a runtime assembly.

- if you are creating custom classes you can also export your schema to and .xsd to be used down the line by either you or another developer.
