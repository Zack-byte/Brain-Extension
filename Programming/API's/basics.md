# API Basics
- API stand for Application Programming Interface

- API's are primarily used to communicate between web applications.

## Common Architectures
- Common architecture styles used to create API's to communicate data are.
  - **REST**
  - **SOAP**
  - **RPC**

## REST 
- Stands for **Representational State Transfer** and is probably the most widely used architecture in the modern era of API's

- Relies on a client/server approach separating fronend and backend

- Provides Considerable Flexibility in development.


- is "stateless". meaning the API stores no data or status between requests. 

- Supports **caching** which stores responses for slow or non-time-sensitive API's

- Can operate through API gateways or load balancers, as well as direct.

## RPC
- **Remote Procedural Call** protocol is a simple means to send multiple parameters and recieve results. 

- Can employ two different languages JSON and XML for coding. (JSON-RPC) (XML-RPC)

## SOAP
- **Simple Object Access Protocol** is a messaging standard defined by the WWW Consortium and broadly used to create web API's. usually with XML

- Supports a wide range of protocols:
  - **HTTP**
  - **SMTP**
  - **TCP**

- Also extensible and style-independent.
- Not as Flexible as REST.
